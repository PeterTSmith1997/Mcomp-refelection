Although I was primarily working alone, I did receive a lot of assistance from academic staff. This was successful because the academic does not have any knowledge of cybersecurity, which meant that I was free to experiment and he was able to advise all the methods used without getting caught up in the smaller details, due to his knowledge of algorithms. Furthermore, the academic had prior knowledge of the project, due to supervision at undergraduate level and therefore understood the project and its complexities. This resulted in a more comprehensive approach to the problem; \cite{thurow1999dynamics} argues that multidisciplinary settings allows individuals from different disciplines to contribute their disciplinary perspectives in an attempt to solve complex problems. This occurred organically in the present research as ideas could be effectively implemented without disagreement, regarding the direction of the project. For example, when analysing the user agents, I had originally tried a Levenshtein distance to try and find the nearest user agent. However, the academic suggested doing a bag of words approach, which was ultimately a stronger and more accurate methodology. 

%The project was a sole effort, there was no instated leader, however, project management strategies were adopted in order to monitor and assure the completion of this quality project (\cite{visser1990expert}). Through building a framework with the option for additional modules to be added, I learned that I have competence as a project leader in terms of project management. The time management of the project was well overseen and time critical elements were put in place, however, the use of a GANTT chart was considered unfitting for the project. AJ Shenhar states that, \textit{"project management differs with the kind of project, and that management style, attitude, and practice must be adapted to the specific project type"} (\cite{Shenhar1}; 33). In short this means that different projects require different management styles. Using this project as an example, not having an initial GANTT chart led to a more agile approach.

%In a team related project there may have been issues regarding the overall build of the software including the login screen. An article by \citeauthor{GanttPRO} discusses the 10 major pitfalls in team based project management, one of the pitfalls being; setting unrealistic deadlines. (\cite{GanttPRO}). This may have lead to overall communication problems and further compatibility issues for adding further module content, due to deadlines not being met and the delay of the project. A great deal of skill development around project management would have to be achieved, especially with time management and communication skills.


Throughout the year myself and my supervisor tried to get into a regular habit of meeting. Keeping us both informed as to where the research was and what needed to be undertaken for the following week. This also prevented delays in the research if I got stuck on something. Momentum easily kept going and I was able to establish if a method was working or not. One of the downsides of this was if there had been a slow progress week it felt like I hadn't done anything, which negatively impacted my motivation. The project was never planned out at the start, this led to a more agile development. Because this work was highly experimental, it required a different approach to manage the project. This is inline with AJ Shenhar's theory on project management (\cite{Shenhar1}). Furthermore, due to the novel nature of the work there was a danger that I would set unrealisitic deadlines to get the work done, which is deemed by \citeauthor{GanttPRO} to be one of ten major pitfalls of projects success(\cite{GanttPRO}). 

Also, some of our meetings involved brainstorming on whiteboards, this was sometimes difficult to read if the meeting was on Teams, due to bad internet connection. This would have been avoidable if my support had been properly arranged in advance of my return to University.

As there is a lack of research in the area I was researching, it may have made it challenging for someone to join the project and be able to completely understand the complexity of the project. Theoretically by working alone it made the ethics application easier, as I relied on getting data from customer websites. They already knew who I was and as a result were more willing to share their data with me for this project as well. However, there were times when having more than one dedicated researcher would have been beneficial. For example, when classifying the accuracy of the program it might have been beneficial to have someone to classify the data as well. This would help to remove any bias that I might have had.

The work for this module was meant to be undertaken as a group research project, however it was decided early on that I would complete it as an individual. Primarily due to the fact that the work was heavily linked to the work carried out for my undergrad dissertation. Most of the underlying software was written as a part of my dissertation, therefore most of the work was identifying small improvements that could be made. Then developing a methodology to prove that accuracy of the program. It may have been useful to get new ideas in, which may have led to a better outcome. If I were to have worked in a group the collaboration would have been beneficial as Robert E. Levasseur (2010) states, "to initiate and... the high level of two-way communication" (\cite{levasseur2010people}). Retrospectively, the initiation process occurred very naturally between myself and Nick. While on placement, we chatted about a problem that I was having with an IP address attacking my website and suggested that I programme something to detect the attack. This sparked a reciprocal flow of ideas that continued throughout the research, even if some elements were absent from the final project. Although Nick did not have any knowledge of cyber-security, he did know a lot about programming algorithms. It can be shown that the more collaboration that exists in research projects, the higher the quality of the research (\cite{figg2006scientific}). Therefore the collaboration within this project led to a better output but other collaborators would have increased this further. 


%The initiation for this project was started while I was on placement. I chatted to Nick about a problem that I was having with an IP address attacking my website and made a comment about 'I should be able to programme something to identify the attack'. Nick then started drawing some user interfaces that didn't end up coming into the final project. However this initiation felt very natural and began some good two way communication with ideas flowing backwards and forwards, and set us up for good communication backwards and forewords due to the fact we both felt invested in the project and when communicating, we allowed each other space to come up with new ideas.
% However, this research has never been undertaken before; it may have been hard for new people to come in and understand the research.


If this had been an entirely new project it would have been beneficial to collaborate with more than one person. To bring in new ideas and a different point of view. However due to the fact that it was a continuation I believe it was the right decision to do it on my own.
