\subsection{Scope}

The scope of this work was to continue the work started in my undergraduate project. 


\subsection{Objectives}

I had to remove an objective, which would have been to develop a better way to assign risk to a country. I intended to look at the number of attacks coming from IP addresses within a country compared to the size of the population. However, due to time constraints I encountered due to a lack of support from the University, I kept the current methodology. This was just looking at the number of attacks from within a country.

\subsection{Risk}

The biggest risk associated with this project was the lack of previous work. Because, there was a question in my mind that this methodology seemed so simple and obvious, why had nobody tried this before? Was it because it did not work? This risk was mitigated due to the fact that, even if the conclusion was that this methodology did not work it would still be a valid conclusion to make.
