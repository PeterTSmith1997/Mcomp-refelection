\subsection{Ethics}
there was a delay in receiving ethical approval due to the ambiguity of user consent in the collection of website log data, and whether users had given informed consent about the collection. Websites say that data can be analysed however due to the university policy of expressed consent, there were questions about whether the data could be used. However, due to the study wanting real-world data, this might have changed user behaviour, knowing that they would've been tracked. After my ethics form asked for clarification the second time, I met with Jamie Mahoney who advised that we should look at GDPR. In particular article 14 paragraph 5, which states if it is too much effort to get a form of consent then you do not need it (look at the actual statement). Upon reflection I should have contacted Jamie earlier. This is also a legal issue and it is the same as the ethical problem.

Another ethical implication of the work may be the fact that  entire country is given a risk. This is mainly done to give the software an idea of context, however a user from a high risk country can still get a low overall risk score.

\section{Legal Issues}
There was a potential legal issue as people could not opt out of the data analysis. This is due to the fact that as soon as they went on to the website their IP address was logged. Most websites privacy policy state that IP addresses will be logged and used for analysis, therefore most users should be aware of how their data will be used.
